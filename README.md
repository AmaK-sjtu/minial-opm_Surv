opm_Surv: Multi-modal Fusion for Survival Analysis
Introduction
opm_Surv is a comprehensive tool designed for multi-modal fusion of multi-omics data (including gene expression, methylation, and mutation) and pathological images. It aims to provide a robust framework for overall survival analysis by integrating diverse data sources at the decision level. This approach leverages the complementary information from different modalities to enhance the accuracy and reliability of survival predictions.
Features

    Multi-modal Fusion: Integrates gene expression, methylation, mutation data, and pathological images.
    Decision Level Fusion: Combines predictions from different modalities to improve overall survival analysis.
    Pre-trained Models: Checkpoints are provided for quick start and reproducibility.
    Demo Data: Sample datasets are included for easy testing and validation.

Tested Datasets
We have tested the effectiveness of opm_Surv using the following datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):

    Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)
    Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
    Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)

These datasets demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach in handling diverse cancer types.
